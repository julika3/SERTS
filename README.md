# SER-TS Interactive Python Map of European LNG Terminals until 2030

The map is embedded in a web application that can be run via the main.py script. The project is structured in a way that
has fully functional methods functions for an interactive map as well as two stats tools which are then embedded in the 
web application. This means that if desired the functions can also easily be implemented in other scripts.

In the project folder there are also two Excel files, which serve as databases. File names and header names are 
implemented as constants to make changes to these files possible. Furthermore, different databases can be used if they 
contain all the information as detailed in the column names constants and are imported as pandas Dataframes.
